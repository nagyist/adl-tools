feature -- Access

feature -- Status Report

feature -- Comparison

	occurrences_conforms_to (other: C_OBJECT): BOOLEAN
			-- if `other' is a C_COMPLEX_OBJECT, then always True, since if occurrences defined on proxy node,
			-- it is an override of  the occurrences on the target, and it doesn't have to conform to anything
			-- except the containing attribute's cardinality
			-- However, if `other' is also a C_COMPLEX_OBJECT then the override is of another use_node, and normal
			-- occurrences apply

feature -- Modification
