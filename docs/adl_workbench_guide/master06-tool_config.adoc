= Tool Configuration

== Set-up

In order to work with the examples described below, the following configuration is advised. Experienced users may skip this step.

=== RM Schema configuration

Reference Model (RM) Schemas are used by the ADL Workbench to validate archetypes and templates. Schemas are expressed as {openehr_odin}[ODIN files^] and have a `.bmm` ({openehr_bmm}[BMM, basic meta-model^]) extension. These schemas are defined in a nested way, with most files visible here being used as component schemas for a small number of top-level schemas representing the openEHR Reference Model, EN13606 model and so on.

The primary location for openEHR schemas is the {openehr_its_bmm}[specifications-ITS-BMM Github repository^]. This contains schemas for all openEHR models, in BMM form. To use the repository as a model source for the AWB, clone it into a convenient area. Then use the RM Schemas dialog to use them, as follows:

* Select `RM Schemas menu > Configure Schemas...` in the menu;
* Use the `RM schema directory` field at the bottom to browse for and add the cloned repository - specify the path `/components`;
* Click `Reload`;
* Ensure that the schemas you require are checked, as shown link:{images_uri}/options_rm_schema_config.png[here].
* Save the configuration.

Several RM schemas are provided with the AWB, which are copies of the controlled versions found in the {openehr_adl_archetypes_github}[adl-archetypes GitHub repository^]. Whether using the bundled or Github repository schemas, you will need to have all the relevant RM schemas selected within the workbench, for your archetypes to work. 

== The .cfg file

=== Setting options in the workbench

Normally, all tool options are set from within the workbench, from the Options Dialog, reached from the Tools menu. It looks like this.

=== Location on various Platforms

Options for the ADL workbench, and also the command line tool adlc are located in a .cfg file named after the particular tool e.g. `adl_workbench.cfg`, `adlc.cfg`. This file will be in the standard application configuration area for your operating system. For `adl_workbench` for example, it will be in a location like the following:

* *Windows 7/10*: `C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\openEHR\adl_workbench\adl_workbench.cfg`
* *Mac OSX*: `$HOME/openEHR/adl_workbench/adl_workbench.cfg`
* *Linux*: `$HOME/openEHR/adl_workbench/adl_workbench.cfg`

Although each tool normally has its own `.cfg` file, the file `adl_workbench.cfg` is assumed to be the default. This means for example that if there is no `adlc/adlc.cfg`, but an `adl_workbench.cfg` file is found, it will be used.

=== Contents

The ADL .cfg file is in ODIN format, and will typically include lines such as the following example (Windows), corresponding to the above configuration.
